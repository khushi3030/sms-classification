The SMS classification model involves training a machine learning model to automatically categorize incoming text messages, distinguishing between spam and legitimate communication. Using a labeled dataset, the model learns patterns and features within the text, enabling accurate classification. Once trained, the system has been deployed on heroku for real-time SMS filtering, enhancing user experience by prioritizing important messages and mitigating the impact of spam. Continuous monitoring and periodic updates ensure the model's effectiveness in adapting to evolving communication patterns.
